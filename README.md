# Library-Management-SQL-Exercise
 This project demonstrates how to use SQLite to manage data for a library system. It includes SQL scripts to create tables, insert data, and run queries to analyze and manage the library's information.


# Features

# Tables:
Authors: Stores information about authors, including their first name, last name, and nationality.
Books: Stores information about books, including the title, description, and the associated author.

# Data Insertion:
Inserts 5 authors and 10 books into the database.

# Queries:
Count the total number of books.
Identify the author with the most books.
Count the number of books by nationality.

# Files
create_tables.sql: Contains SQL commands to create the Authors and Books tables. 

insert_data.sql: Contains SQL commands to insert sample data into the Authors and Books tables.

queries.sql: Contains SQL queries to analyze the library data.


# Getting Started
